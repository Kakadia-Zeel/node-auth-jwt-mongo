# Smoothies App 
Simple Smoothie App where new user can Sign Up along with Login functionality. Only Authenticated user can see Menu of Smoothies else they have to Signup with Email and Password. 

### Project Overview :
I have created this Project to learn about JSON Web tokens and implementing them at backend side.
Along with this, I got to know mongoose and methods to hash passwords. Handling errors and at server side is also great key of learning. 

For the first time, I've used EJS for client side. Building application with MVC Architecture was a great Experience.
